# 🚕 Taxi Data Analysis & Visualization 

## Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of taxi service data.  
The goal is to uncover patterns related to taxi companies, temporal trends, and customer payment behavior through clear and informative visualizations.

During the implementation of this project, **Amazon Web Services (AWS) was used to support data storage, processing, and analysis**, demonstrating a cloud-based and industry-relevant workflow.

The project demonstrates skills in:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Visual storytelling
- Insight-driven analysis
- Communicating results in a professional, portfolio-ready format

---

## 📌 Key Objectives

- Identify the most active taxi companies
- Analyze ride distribution across months and years
- Examine customer payment preferences
- Provide actionable insights based on observed trends
